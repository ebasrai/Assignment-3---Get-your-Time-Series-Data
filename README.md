| Column   | Description/Definition                                              | Data Type | Example   |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| DATE     | The quarter-end date for the observation period.                     | Date      | 1980-01-01 |
| NYSTHPI  | The house price index for New York (baseline = 100 in Q1 1980).      | Numeric   | 100.00     |

The minimum value that is recorded in the data set is 75.93 and the max as of present day being 1085.92. The data is recorded on a quarterly basis and reported on the first of the day the
new quarter. 

3.) The data is collected by The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). This data is constructed using home purchase and refinance mortgage data from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
    The data is updated on a quarterly basis. The baseline is from the year of 1980, but does have some data dating from 1975.

4.) The reason this data intrigues me is because in the future I want to work in New York and understanding the housing prices is integral to living there. As of now the cost is obviosly
    very high. Trying to figure out how much higher it will become through forecasting can be helpful in budgeting.
